Ludum Dare 38 - A Small World<br />
**Araneus - Madness of the wicked one**

![](http://sava.ninja/img/araneus/shot2.jpg)

Once upon a time,<br />
there was a great<br />
guitar player.<br />
HE WANTED TO BE THE BEST!<br />

He tried to play the forbidden song,<br />
but the DEMONS never rest.<br />

DEMOn from the hell AWOKEN,<br />
"WHO ARE YOU to BREAK MY SLUMBER?"<br />
"Be small and silent" -<br />
he said,<br />
"Let 8 be your number!"<br />

Into the spider he turned,<br />
no tongue to speak left.<br />
To have revenge,<br />
holy grenades he has to get!<br />
